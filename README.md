# Ridge_Penalty_Parameter
This is my final project for the course STAT 2270 - Data Mining by Dr. Lucas Mentch (Fall 2020).\
The project is a summary of *“Influence of single observations on the choice of the penalty parameter in ridge regression”* by Kristoffer H. Hellton, Camilla Lingjærde, and Riccardo De Bin (arXiv: 1911.03662, November 2019).\
I replicated the results presented in the original paper on the Boston housing dataset from the MASS package in R.
